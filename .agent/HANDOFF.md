# HANDOFF

## Current State

- The repo now has a queue-driven autonomous control plane rooted in `AGENT.md` and `.agent/*`, plus a machine-checkable queue validator.
- `cp-001`, `cp-002`, `cp-003`, `sat-001`, `tool-001`, `perf-001`, and `perf-002` are complete.
- The queue has been reopened with a rolling native-only optimization program.
- There is no active in-progress task; the next deterministic task is `perf-003`.

## What Changed This Run

- Seeded a new performance queue for ongoing SAT optimization work instead of leaving the repo with no queued tasks.
- Encoded the user’s long-running optimization goal as bounded benchmark-driven tasks so future runs can keep making deterministic progress.
- Clarified that external solvers or libraries may be used during research only as non-retained references; the retained solver and default verification remain standard-library only.

## Current Focus

- Start `perf-003` next: refresh the same-day native-only exact-CLI baseline and pick the next hotspot slice from fresh evidence.

## Recommended Next Tasks

- `perf-003` — refresh the native-only exact-CLI baseline and hotspot slice
- `perf-004` — test one propagation or clause-storage micro-optimization after the baseline refresh
- `perf-005` — test one bounded branching or restart heuristic change after the baseline refresh

## Verification From This Run

- `python tools/agent_queue_check.py` — passed
- `python tools/codex_verify.py` — passed
- `git diff --check` — passed

## Notes For The Next Run

- Start with the read order in `.agent/RUNBOOK.md`.
- Reconcile `STATE.yaml` against the repo tree before selecting a task.
- Keep `PLANS.md` updated for any multi-step or code-bearing task.
- Reuse the queue checker when adjusting `.agent/STATE.yaml` or `.agent/TASK_QUEUE.yaml`.
- The default verifier covers `satsolver_fast.py`, but `satsolver_pysat.py` remains outside the default gate because it requires an optional external environment.
- External libraries or solvers may be used as short-lived research references only; do not retain them in the submission path or make them a default verifier dependency.
- After each performance experiment, either split the next evidence-backed task into `.agent/TASK_QUEUE.yaml` or record a retained-noop conclusion; do not collapse the queue back into one endless vague task.

## Immediate Constraints

- Keep the submission path standard-library only.
- Preserve `python satsolver.py input.cnf output.txt`.
- Do not update `benchmark_summary.md` or `experiments.jsonl` unless a performance result is kept.
- External comparison tooling is allowed only for research and must not become a retained submission dependency.

## Repo Truths To Preserve

- `satsolver_core.py` is the shared CDCL implementation.
- `satsolver_io.py` is the shared DIMACS parsing and result-writing helper for thin wrappers.
- `tools/checker.py` is the correctness oracle for solver output format.
- `tools/agent_queue_check.py` is the control-plane consistency oracle.
- `tools/codex_verify.py` is expected to cover both `satsolver.py` and `satsolver_fast.py` smoke paths by default.
- The retained portfolio thresholds still intentionally gate only `large/test_8.cnf` until a same-day broader threshold change wins cleanly.
- Same-day exact-CLI evidence is stronger than stale benchmark history when timing signals are close.
- External solvers or libraries may inform research, but only native-only wins belong in the retained solver path.
